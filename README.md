e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.

git-diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository. 
It typically represents the latest stable version of the project and serves as the default branch for collaboration.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, it's generally not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch, especially in collaborative projects. 
Instead, it's best practice to create a new branch for your changes, make and commit your modifications to that branch, 
and then open a pull request for review before merging it into the main branch.
